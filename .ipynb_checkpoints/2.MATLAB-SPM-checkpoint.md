# Installing MATLAB and SPM
As mentioned in the previous section, SPM is the software we will be using to analyse brain images on this course. SPM is developed by the [Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging](https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/) at University College London (UCL). It is notable for being written in the MATLAB programming language, meaning that we need a copy of MATLAB in order for SPM to run.

## MATLAB
MATLAB (MATrix LABoratory) is a scientific computing environment and programming language developed by the MathWorks corporation. It was originally developed to allow for easy programming using concepts from linear algebra. Since then, the software has expanded into a large suite of functions that include image processing, computer vision, statistics, machine learning and graphical user interfaces. In this section, we will see how to install MATLAB (if you want it on your own computer) and have a quick tour of the interface. We will begin learning how to use MATLAB in the next section.

### Installing MATLAB
MATLAB is not free software. If you are using a University cluster PC, MATLAB will already be ready for you to use. However, if you are planning on using your own computer, you will need to install MATLAB using the University license. First, visit the [Mathworks website](https://uk.mathworks.com/) and then click the `Get MATLAB` button. You will be prompted to create an account. Make sure you do this using your University email address so that the license is available. Once you have signed in, click the `Install MATLAB` button. Once you are on the downloads page, you can select the version that you want to install. For Windows, just install the latest version. If you are using a Mac, make sure you install version `R2023a`, otherwise there will be compatibility issues with SPM12. Once downloaded, just run the installer and MATLAB will be available to use.

### The MATLAB InterfaceÂ¶
Once open, it is a good idea to familiarise yourself with the MATLAB layout. The video below will provide a brief tour of the MATLAB interface.

## SPM
SPM is one of the oldest and most widely used software packages for processing and analysing brain images. It was originally developed by Karl Friston in the early 90s as a means of analysing PET data, but was soon expanded for the analysis of fMRI, MEG and EEG datasets. SPM12 is the 5th major version of the SPM software, released at the end of 2012. Many of the approaches we use to analyse neuroimaging data were initially developed by the SPM team, as discussed in the retrospective by [Ashburner (2012)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.10.025). 

## Installing SPM
At its most basic, SPM is a collection of MATLAB scripts. You download the software as a folder, tell MATLAB where that folder is located and then launch the software by typing spm at the MATLAB prompt. The three main windows of SPM will then open, as shown in the screenshot below.

In order to install SPM, follow along with the video below. You will see how to download the software, get it working with MATLAB and the finally how to use SPM to view an example image (which you can download from [here](https://github.com/martynmcfarquhar/NCCNDatasets/blob/2021-22/F%26CN/1b.ComputationalTools/comp_tools_anat1.nii?raw=1)). Note that if you are using macOS, there will be some additional steps to perform to get SPM working, which are explained in the section below the video.


### Resolving Errors on macOS
For anyone installing SPM on macOS, there are some additional steps that will be required before the software will function correctly.
