    "# MATLAB and Linear Algebra\n",
    "As mentioned in the previous section, SPM is a software package that is built *on top* of the MATLAB scientific computing environment. Although possible to use SPM without any further knowledge of MATLAB, there is an argument to be made for being at least a *bit* familiar with the MATLAB language. Unfortunately, we do not have time on this course for in-depth training on computer programming. However, we can start using MATLAB as a way of understanding some of the mathematical theory that we will need going forward. This will do double-duty as both a way of getting familiar with MATLAB and a way of learning some mathematical concepts in a more interactive fashion. \n",

    "### The MATLAB Prompt\n",
    "In order to communicate with MATLAB, we use the MATLAB prompt. The prompt is signified in the Command Window by the two angled brackets `>>`. These brackets indicate where we can type commands for MATLAB to interpret. We type something at the prompt, hit <kbd>ENTER</kbd> and then whatever we typed gets sent to the MATLAB interpreter. If MATLAB understands what we typed, it will return the answer. If MATLAB does not understand what we typed, it will return an error.\n",

Errors will decrease with experience, but they will never disappear. The trick is not to panic, but to read what the error says slowly and carefully. Although tempting to assume the problem is with MATLAB, 9/10 it is a user error. As such, you need to try and develop some skills in discerning what seemingly cryptic error messages mean so that you do not get stuck.

We have not touched any programming concepts beyond simply variable assignment, however, if you want to make the most of MATLAB as a tool then you will need to learn to use it as a programming language. Although not an essential part of this course, this would be a skill that will come in very handy in Semester 2, as well as in your dissertation project work. There are many resources available to learn to programme in MATLAB and we would encourage everyone to try and go through them as part of the additional reading throughout this course.

An if-statement allows us to ask a question and then decide whether to run some code or not, depending on the answer.

    "An important part of the for-loop is the index variable which tells us the current iteration of the loop. In the example above, the index variable is called i. We asked MATLAB to start i with a value of 1 and then continue adding 1 until it reached the value of number, at which point the loop will exit. This is all given in the syntax for i = 1:number. On the first iteration of the loop, i will have a value of 1, on the second iteration i will have a value of 2 and so on. The utility of this is that we can use i inside the loop to know which iteration is currently running. In the example above, we used this to add the current number onto the previous sum, but the real utility of this is that we can use i to select different variables for each iteration of the loop. For instance, if we had a list of images we wanted to process we can use a for-loop and then use the index variable to select the correct image on each iteration. \n",

    "So what we have done here is saved code in a format where we can use it again simply by typing `add_five` with whatever argument we like. Now, obviously, a function that just adds 5 to a number is a bit useless. However, if you think of something more complex, such as reading neuroimaging data from a file name and returning a matrix of voxel values, you can start appreciating the power of functions. Not only do they make code re-useable, but they also make code easier to understand. For instance, seeing `image = read_data('image_file.nii')` in a script is a lot easier to understand than suddenly seeing 300 lines of code for reading the file from disk. We will see functions come up a lot during this course, mainly in terms of the functions that come with SPM. The main thing to understand is that a function is effectively hiding code from you and that in order to use a function you just need understand what it needs in terms of input variables and what it will return in terms of output variables.\n",

    "It may seem unfair to call this section a brief introduction to programming in MATLAB, however, the world of computer programming is huge and we have only covered the very basics here. If you are new to programming, this may have felt a bit overwhelming, but do not worry. As we said at the outset, treat this section as a reference that you can come back to in future. A lot of these topics will become clearer over time as you see more examples of code and scripts. What we want at this stage is for you to have some familiarity with this so that the first time you see a MATLAB script you are not doing so cold. We will be providing more guidance on this as we go through the course. If this has whetted your appetite and you want to learn more, there are many books on MATLAB programming, such as MATLAB for Psychologists by Borgo, Soranzo and Grassi."
