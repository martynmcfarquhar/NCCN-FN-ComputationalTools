    "# MATLAB Programming\n",
    "You should now have some idea about both MATLAB and SPM. Although possible to use SPM without any further knowledge of MATLAB, there is an argument to be made for being at least a bit familiar with MATLAB programming. Although many of our initial interactions with SPM will be via its graphical interface, understanding how programming works, even superficially, will pay dividends in the future. For starters, understanding how to program in MATLAB can be instructive because you can use MATLAB to play around with some of the concepts we will be learning about. This is something we will be doing in the synchronous sessions and so the more familiarity you have before these sessions the better. In addition, there are elements of SPM that can be automated with just a bit of programming knowledge. This can save a huge amount of time and effort and is particularly important if you are looking towards a research career. We will not be getting into this aspect too much yet, but we will do in Advanced Image Analysis in Semester 2 and so building a good foundation now is no bad thing. If nothing else, programming is a very useful transferable skill that warrants some degree of attention.\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing to note about this section is that it is written as more of a reference for future use and can be a bit tedious to go through. We would recommend doing it at this stage, but you may want to return here when you see some of these elements later in the course in order to contextualise their use. You also do not need to memorise any of this, just read through it and try and get the gist. You may want to have MATLAB open as well so you can try some of the code for yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The MATLAB Prompt\n",
    "In order to interact with MATLAB, we have to use the MATLAB prompt. The prompt is signified in the Command Window by the two angled brackets >>. These brackets indicate where we can type in commands for MATLAB to interpret. The general workflow is that we type something at the prompt, hit the <ENTER> key and then whatever we typed gets sent to the MATLAB interpreter to try and make sense of it. If MATLAB understands what we typed then it will do whatever we asked and return the answer. If MATLAB does not understand what we typed, it will return an error trying to tell us what it did not understand. Alternatively, MATLAB might understand us, but then runs into problems trying to do what we asked it to do. In this case it will also return an error telling us what went wrong.\n",

    "Throughout this section, we will indicate MATLAB code like this"

    "When faced with an error, part of the skill of computer programming is trying to work out why the command failed. Even for seasoned programmers, errors are common. Errors will decrease with experience, but they will never disappear. The trick is not panicking when you see red text, but rather reading what it says carefully and trying to fix it quickly. In the error above, MATLAB is telling us that it does not understand what $ means, but note that errors will not always be this obvious. More times than not, the problem is a user error. So the best advice we can give when faced with a problem is to look for mistakes you have made as carefully as possible.

These are pieces of text that MATLAB will ignore, but serve as notes for our future selves. You can include a comment in a script by typing the percentage symbol, followed by whatever text you like.

An if-statement allows us to ask a question and then decide whether to run some code or not, depending on the answer.

We asked MATLAB to start i with a value of 1 and then continue adding 1 until it reached the value of number, at which point the loop will exit. This is all given in the syntax for i = 1:number. On the first iteration of the loop, i will have a value of 1, on the second iteration i will have a value of 2 and so on. The utility of this is that we can use i inside the loop to know which iteration is currently running. In the example above, we used this to add the current number onto the previous sum, but the real utility of this is that we can use i to select different variables for each iteration of the loop. For instance, if we had a list of images we wanted to process we can use a for-loop and then use the index variable to select the correct image on each iteration. \n",

We actually saw a character array earlier when we specified the `hello_text` variable. Rather than being a variable with a single value, what was returned was actually a character array with 1 row and as many columns as letters. So a character array is really the same as a matrix, but the rows and columns refer to letters instead of numbers. A limitation to this approach, however, is that if you want multiple rows there needs to be the same number of characters in each row."
